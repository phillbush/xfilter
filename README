                                XFilter

XFilter is an interactive filter for X11.
It's basically dmenu, but with some features.

XFilter is based on xprompt and share much of the code.
But xprompt grew too much and got a complex interface.
Xfilter is my attempt to simplify it.

Namely, the following are features of xfilter that are not in dmenu:

• Text selection (both via mouse or via Shift+Arrow).
• Mouse support.
• History.
• File name completion (with `-f` option).
• Items can have descriptions
• Items can be grouped
• Support for input methods with on-the-spot pre-editing.
• Undo/redo (by default bound to Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Shift-Z).
• Copy/paste both via mouse and keybindings.
• Xfilter does not set the override-redirect flag.

XFilter does not set the override-redirect flag.  This means that
XFilter is a regular window managed by the window manager; consequently,
XFilter does not manage itself, and it has no knowledge of monitors,
gravity or window border (all of that should be set by the window
manager).

The input is a TSV (tab separated values).  The first value is what will
appear on the list to be matched; the second value is a description that
will also appear on the list but cannot be matched; the third value is a
string that will be output if the item is selected.   Each value but the
first one is optional.

If the -g flag is active, lines read from stdin must be grouped in line
blocks delimited by blank lines.  Each group must begin with a line
whose only content is the name of the group.  The remaining lines of
each group are displayed for the user to select.  When the user selects
an item from a group, this item is printed to the stdout prefixed with
the name of the group it came from.

Options are:
• -f:           List filenames.
• -g:           Group items.
• -h histfile:  Use histfile for history.
• -i:           Case insensitive matching.
• -p:           Password mode.
