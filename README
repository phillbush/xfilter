                                XFilter

XFilter is an interactive filter for X11.
It's basically dmenu, but with some features.

XFilter is based on xprompt and share much of the code.
But xprompt grew too much and got a complex interface.
Xfilter is my attempt to simplify it.

Namely, the following are features of xfilter that are not in dmenu:

• Text selection (both via mouse or via Shift+Arrow).
• Mouse support.
• History.
• File name completion (with `-f` option).
• Items can have descriptions
• Support for input methods with on-the-spot pre-editing.
• Undo/redo (by default bound to Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Shift-Z).
• Copy/paste both via mouse and keybindings.
• Xfilter does not set the override-redirect flag.

XFilter does not set the override-redirect flag.  This means that
XFilter is a regular window managed by the window manager; consequently,
XFilter does not manage itself, and it has no knowledge of monitors,
gravity or window border (all of that should be set by the window
manager).

Options are:
• -f:           List filenames.
• -h histfile:  Use histfile for history.
• -p:           Password mode.
• -d:           Enable description.
• -o:           Enable hidden output.
